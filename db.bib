abstract = "The diffusion of Open Government Data (OGD) in recent years kept a very fast pace. However, evidence from practitioners shows that disclosing data without proper quality control may jeopardize dataset reuse and negatively affect civic participation. Current approaches to the problem in literature lack a comprehensive theoretical framework. Moreover, most of the evaluations concentrate on open data platforms, rather than on datasets. In this work, we address these two limitations and set up a framework of indicators to measure the quality of Open Government Data on a series of data quality dimensions at most granular level of measurement. We validated the evaluation framework by applying it to compare two cases of Italian OGD datasets: an internationally recognized good example of OGD, with centralized disclosure and extensive data quality controls, and samples of OGD from decentralized data disclosure (municipality level), with no possibility of extensive quality controls as in the former case, hence with supposed lower quality. Starting from measurements based on the quality framework, we were able to verify the difference in quality: the measures showed a few common acquired good practices and weaknesses, and a set of discriminating factors that pertain to the type of datasets and the overall approach. On the basis of this evaluation, we also provided technical and policy guidelines to overcome the weaknesses observed in the decentralized release policy, addressing specific quality aspects."

abstract = "The claim of the open government data (OGD) movement is that it would add considerable value to the political, economic and social development of nations. Thus, during the past few years, governments around the world have been under increasing pressure to release data to encourage citizen participation in government. In the UK, the government publishes its data on the data.gov.uk website for the public to find, view, download and interrogate.11See: https://data.gov.uk/. In this paper, we evaluate the extent of openness of OGD in the UK – a recognised global leader in the OGD movement – by examining a sample of 400 datasets listed on this website. The examination uses an ‘ordinary citizen’ test, which is developed based on the original eight Sebastopol principles of open data. Our examination discovers that existing prevalent measures of openness of data are inadequate. Our findings demonstrate that the majority of the published government resources on the website are informational rather than granular data. In fact, only a small minority of these advertised as open data are actually open, which severely limits their open government utilities."

	abstract = {Purpose This paper aims to advance a total quality management ({TQM}) model for the open government data ({OGD}) initiatives undertaken by the governments. As an example, the paper investigates the national {OGD} portal of India (www.data.gov.in) and provides implications of the proposed {TQM} model for the Indian case.Design/methodology/approach The {TQM} model for the {OGD} initiatives (16 dimensions in terms of drivers, enablers and results) is derived from the extant literature on the principles of {TQM} and {OGD}. The proposed model is used for drawing implications for the Indian {OGD} initiative.Findings The application of {TQM} model for the {OGD} initiative in India would help in quality maintenance and sustainability. The quality of the {OGD} portal should be improved by taking the {TQM} model as a point of reference.Practical implications Ensuring quality of the datasets is important for any {OGD} initiative. The proposed {TQM} model leaves insights for the practitioners (policymakers and administrators) to implement the {TQM} model in the {OGD} policy initiatives. This would lead to increased trust, transparency and accountability.Social implications Through the integration of the {TQM} model in the {OGD} initiative of the country, a wider section of the stakeholders may tap the qualitatively advanced datasets for value creation. Citizen participation and engagement would increase with the integration of the {TQM} model in the {OGD} initiative.Originality/value While management of quality in the {OGD} initiatives has been underlined in the extant {OGD}-focused literature, the utility of applying {TQM} principles in {OGD} initiatives has not been conceived so far. The present study seeks to contribute towards the extant literature on {TQM} and {OGD} with the identification of the {TQM} model for the {OGD} initiatives.},
